# Governance

Blockly Student OSS is a **maintainer-led open-source project**.

---

## Project Ownership

The project is owned and maintained by the original author.

There is currently:
- One primary maintainer
- No formal core team
- No voting or committee structure

---

## Decision Making

All final decisions regarding:

- Features
- Architecture
- Merges
- Releases
- Roadmap direction

are made by the maintainer.

Community feedback is valued, but the maintainer retains final authority to ensure the project remains stable, secure, and aligned with its goals.

---

## Maintainer Responsibilities

The maintainer is responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases
- Ensuring security best practices
- Setting overall project direction

There is no obligation to accept or respond to every contribution or request.

---

## Becoming a Maintainer

At this time, there is no formal process for adding maintainers.

This may change in the future if the project grows significantly.

---

## Scope Limitations

This project intentionally avoids:

- Enterprise features
- Multi-user administration
- School-wide management tools
- Complex backend infrastructure

Requests outside this scope may be declined.

## Changes to Governance

This governance model may evolve as the project grows. Any major changes will be documented in this file.
